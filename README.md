# AE_Data_Analysis
AE signal waveform analysis  

The Matlab codes in this repository are developed to analyze AE signal waveforms generated during fatigue tests. Waveforms are coresponding to valid signals selected by the codes in "Data_Integration_Multiple_Source" repository. 

Simply, the problem definition is:
We are interested to study the change in information entropy of signal waveforms in course of fatigue test.
